# CS-305-X6360-Software-Security
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial firm looking to update it security by implementing RESTful web application programming interface and updating its security to current standards.

    What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
    
There are two thinks that I am now very comfortable with. The first thing that I was able to figure out with some research was implementing SHA-256 hash coding and working through the vulnerability assessment. It is very important to code as securely as possible because bad code can lead to vulnerabilities that hackers can use to gain access to the system. Keeping security up to date protect the company from being hacked. When companies get hack the loss of data can lead to the loss of millions of dollars to recover and most likely the loss of consumer confidence. Some never recover and have to close their doors.  

    What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
    
The vulnerability assessment is a very helpful tool that lays out all the vulnerabilities that are found in one report that can be used to develop a plan on updating the security of the company.

    How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
    
When approaching the need to increase layers of security I used the vulnerability assessment as a guide to go through each step to identify where the security holes are. The techniques or strategies that I will use in the future will be identifying the client’s needs, Areas of security that need to be addressed, Manual code review and Static testing using tools such as dependency reports. 

    How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
    
After refactoring the code. I did a manual code review using the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram as a guide to identify any new vulnerabilities. 

    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    
In future tasks or assignments, I will think of security as a process that needs to happen at all points of development. I will use best secure coding practices and implement tools such as dependency scans. 

    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
    
 I would showcase both of my projects as they cover everything I learn from this course.
